# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository contains all projects I did in Artificial Intelligence course (offered at the University of Tehran under the supervision of Dr. Fadaei). 

Project0: Crunching and visualising data to get familiar with pandas, matplotlib, numpy and Jupyter notebook. Then try to find a simple model that estimates students' chances of getting admission to American universities

Project1: Implementing informed and uninformed search algorithms in python. Use them to solve a problem and compare them to see which one is better in our case.
